Experimenting with making use of the LMI For all data during the
National Hack The Government day (2015).

I downloaded the list of SOC codes from the
[ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-2-the-structure-and-index/index.html#3").

I am too lazy to find out whether I can re-distribute that data so I haven't included it in the repo.
